    1. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
2. After x period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
    1. This will be done programmatically
3. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
    1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
    2. Chainlink Automation -> Time Based Trigger
